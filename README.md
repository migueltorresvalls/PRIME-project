## PRIME Communication System Simulation
This project implements a complete end-to-end simulation of a communication system based on the PRIME (Powerline Intelligent Metering Evolution) standard, ITU-T G.9904. The system is developed in MATLAB and explores the effects of different modulations, channel conditions, and error correction strategies on the bit error rate (BER).

### Features
- Differential modulations: DBPSK, DQPSK, and D8PSK
- OFDM modulation and demodulation
- Channel model with and without dispersion
- Cyclic prefix and frequency domain equalization
- Optional Forward Error Correction (FEC) using convolutional coding
- Bit randomization and interleaving
- BER vs SNR curve generation and comparison with theoretical performance
